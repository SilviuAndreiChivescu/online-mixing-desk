In my Final Year of my Undergraduate Degree, I had the opportunity to work with the Web Audio API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
I have chosen to build an online Audio Mixing Desk with React.js and TypeScript.
Feel free to use this as reference for your Web Audio API project or even to expand further this Mixer. I had lots of fun building this!
